## Objectives
- Join small team and provide technical leadership for advanced simulation and layout flows of PCBs, RF Modules, & Acoustic Devices (Filters)
- Work within and extend existing design flows, to improve them, and set designers up for smooth design & success.
- Ship cool products that everyone loves to use!

## Work Experience
### 2018-Present OG Semi
- Lead Developer of the Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) Filter PDK (C++)
  - Schematic & Layout fully linked with 6 varying simulation models for trade off of speed and accuracy
  - Less than 2 weeks to train RF Designer to be taping out BAW Devices
- Monte Carlo Automations & Sensitivity Analysis (C#)
  - Full simulation of complete fabrication processes
  - 1000 iterations (wafers) w/ 2 stage Monte Carlo in 4-6 hour run-time
  - PZ, Metal, and SiN Trimming w/ recipe based strategy that is fully configurable
- Modelcard Database (C#, MySQL)
  - Centralized MySQL Server that holds all Design Rules, Material Parameters, and Band specific datas
  - Logged and versioned w/ full audit trail of changes
  - Full client-side editor of database allows multiple stack designers to work in parallel

### 2015-2018 TDK
- Co-Developer of the BAW PDK (C++)
  - Creation of many acoustic models based on whitepapers and Matlab prototypes
  - Layout Engine for linking Design Rule Manual with Masks 
- Continuous Integration and Release Server (Powershell, Python)
  - Jenkins Powered w/ 5 Stage Pipeline
  - Regression Testing on Layouts and Simulation of PCells and Models
  - Integration testing for user facing features (Creating Tapeout Geometries, Exporting Tasks)
  - DRC Deck integration for final testing before release of PDK
- AWR Integrations to HFSS/ANSYS (Visual Basic)
  - Designed plugin system for HFSS Link where PDKs can build up 3D models themselves without changing hierarchy walker
  - Full test suite and stackup validation 
- Plot and Graph Automations
  - ...
